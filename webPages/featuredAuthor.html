    <p id="authorBio">
      Patrick Rothfuss always wanted to be fantasy author when he grew up.
      Now that his first novel is published it's generally agreed that he has
      achieved his dream. However, there is some debate as to whether or not
      he has, in fact, grown up. An avid Dungeons and Dragons fan, Rothfuss is
      also known for his love of board games and role playing games. He has guest
      starred multiple times on

         target="elsewhere">Wil Wheaton's <i>Tabletop</i></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Native Wisconsinite, Rothfuss went to DeForest High School and UW Stevens
      Point before getting his masters at Washington State University. He has
      received the Quill Award for Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror in 2007 for his first
      book <i>The Name of the Wind</i>, and the David Gemmel Award for
      best fantasy novel in 2012 for the second book of <i>The Kingkiller
      Chronicle</i> series, <i>Wise Man's Fear</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, Rothfuss has published <i>The Slow Regard of Silent
      Things</i>&mdash;which is a companion tale to <i>The Kingkiller Chronicle</i>
      series&mdash;and two novella stories of his have been published in
      anthologies: "How Old Holly Came To Be", in <i>Unfettered</i>, and
      <i>The Lightning Tree</i> in <i>Rogues</i>.

    <h3>Reviews</h3>
    <p>
      "I was reminded of Ursula LeGuin, George R. R. Martin, and J. R. R.
      Tolkien, but never felt that Rothfuss was imitating anyone. Like the
      writers he clearly admires, he's an old-fashioned storyteller working with
      traditional elements, but his voice is his own. I haven't been so gripped
      by a new fantasy series in years. It's certain to become a classic."
      <br /><b>-The London Times</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      "[<i>The Wise Man's Fear</i>] was worth the wait. I gulped it down in a day,
      staying up almost to dawn reading, and I am already itching for the next
      one. He's bloody good, this Rothfuss guy."
      <br /><b>-George R. R. Martin,</b>
      <br />author of <i>A Game of Thrones</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a magnificent book, a really fine story, highly readable and
      engrossing. I compliment young Pat. His first novel is a great one. Wow!"
