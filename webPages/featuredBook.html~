  <article id="summary">
    During the second half of World War II, a soldier named Yossarian is
    stationed with his Air Force squadron on the island of Pianosa, near the
    Italian coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Yossarian and his friends endure a
    nightmarish, absurd existence defined by bureaucracy and violence: they are
    inhuman resources in the eyes of their blindly ambitious superior officers.
    The squadron is thrown thoughtlessly into brutal combat situations and
    bombing runs in which it is more important for the squadron members to
    capture good aerial photographs of explosions than to destroy their targets.
    Their colonels continually raise the number of missions that they are
    required to fly before being sent home, so that no one is ever sent home.
    Still, no one but Yossarian seems to realize that there is a war going on;
    everyone thinks he is crazy when he insists that millions of people are
    trying to kill him.
